# Road to flash attention
This repo assumes that the reader would be going along the book:
Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach
Book by David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu
https://g.co/kgs/H9Fr3L1

The reader atleast need to go through the first 6 chapters of the book to understand flash attention.
My repo only provides more helpful comments and notes through the exercises and
additionally goes through online softmax which is needed for calculating attention
